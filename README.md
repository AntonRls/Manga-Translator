The essence of the program is that you can highlight the text in the picture and immediately translate it into any language. The program is focused on fast translation of manga, but despite this, it is also suitable for professional translation, due to the fact that the translated text can be edited.

At the moment, the program implements this:
 <ul>
<li>Two tools (Rectangle and Circle)
<li>Translation from Japanese to any other language
<li>The interface is translated into two languages: Russian and English
<li>Settings
<li>Basic tools for working with text (Changing the font size, changing its color, font style, and some others)
<li>Image zoom changes (Only for image editing in the editor, the image itself is saved in its original resolution)
<li>Adaptive interface
<li>Other little things that make the program more pleasant to use
<li>Keyboard shortcut ctrl+z
</ul>
