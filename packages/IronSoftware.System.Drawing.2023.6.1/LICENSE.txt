Permissive Split Licensing
--------------------------------------------
Works in Source or Object form are split licensed and may be licensed your choice of either:
1. Iron Software Commercial Licensing documented below
2. MIT Open Source License included in this document

Iron Commercial Licensing
============================================
You may choose Commercial Licensing for this software and / or its derived works by purchasing “Iron Suite for .NET” at https://ironsoftware.com/suite/

--------------------------------------------
It is often worth paying for something that is free:
* Developer support is available to Commercial Licensing customers when purchased and agreed by both parties.
* Purchasing gives you the option to replace the MIT Open Source license below with Commercial Licensing
    *  Commercial Licensing Terms are found at: https://github.com/iron-software/IronSoftware.System.Drawing/blob/master/NuGet/EULA.txt and within this software.
    *  The MIT public license agreement no longer applies and the MIT license below need not be shipped inside or alongside your software
* Enhanced versions of IronSoftware.Drawing with additional features may be released and available to Commercial Licensing users.
    * This may include:
        * Additional features and documentation
        * The option for no dependency to SixLabors.ImageSharp and its commercial licensing fees for some use cases.

Open Source Licensing
============================================
If Commercial Licensing is not purchased, then Open Source Licensing applies. The MIT License within this license should be included inside your product or project as clearly as possible.
